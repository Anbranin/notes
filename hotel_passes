Scott and.. someone else

Can push out a file that will contain the card number to a CSV file, folder on
the server

Is the file on the same network, can we pick it up
PCI server? Windows server?
PCI environment? 
VM in protected area, scott says. UMass is providing the server.
If we give you an FTP address and credentiasl can you send it to us?
The software can't do it natively it can push it to a folder on the server we
just have to figure out a way to get it to you.

Need to figure out how to grab shit from the server. IP address?

We need:
