### The t2 Flex validation solution - paperless and printable
- Integrates with the eBusiness solution allowing Validation providers (
those who issue validations) to
issue validations, run reports, pay invoices, manage users (Their own users)
from web service
- Issued validations work with the ARC (access and revenue control) 
solution - discounts are applied directly to transient ticket transaction
(without chaser tickets or paper validations)
- Merchants can log into eBusiness site to validate parking by entering
the transient ticket number
- Flex calculates the discount, determines if multiple validations can be used,
associates the ticket with the validation at exit and invoices the merchant (the
department)
- Privileges are granted to individual users and usage can be tracked individually
NOTE: How do we do this? 
- Validations can be prepaid or invoiced

### Printable Validations
- coupon functionality
- can be printed or cliped froma newspaper
- can be barcoded or non-barcoded
- can be unlimited use (means that 5 different customers can use the same coupon
that they've cut out of a newspaper)
- barcoded ones can be used at ARC POS stations
- non-barcoded can be used at cashier station only

You can issue a validation from T2 systems, however we wish to do it from TPP
instead of using the portal or whatever.

The cashier station needs a way to accept the validations manually, but I think
we don't need to set anything up with that.
