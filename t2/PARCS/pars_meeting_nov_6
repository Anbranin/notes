Always make them available for the encoding station because you never know.
(validation control groups)

The only solution for the scenario expiration date for the event

Flat Rate:
  The only solution for that is for the attendee to purchase a day pass.
  If it were a coupon every time they exit they'd be charged
  Could obtain a second validation for 100% so they could exit for free
  OR the event organizer could print them a day pass - direct to cashier station
  Cashier could turn their transient ticket into a day pass
  Central Cashier - has a staff person - that person is not available for this
  solution.. We physically will not have a person available
  
  That's the only option is the day pass though, for the flat rate thing..
  Could we use the day pass functionality usable by other departments so we could use
  this functionality?

  What will stop them distributing the second validation?

Hotel day pass - max days. determines days

Refunds - ???
  
Flex port
