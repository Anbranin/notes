#Permit Renewals
How can we make things go smoothly?

##Document the Process
- Eases office turnover
- notes and comments can be helpful
- You can leave things better than you found it

## Configuration -> Permit Number Ranges -> Permit Control Groups
- Make sure `is_renewable` is checked
- look at the "Fee Schedules" in there

## Extend Expiration Date
- That's another thing we can do instead of replacing it with another permit
- Term type, term length, total fee amount
