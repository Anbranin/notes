# Where is PARCS headed?
## Fixed License Plate Recognition

- The license plate is used as a credential. Multiple license plates can be 
attached to one permit.
- Transient Ticket entry date/time tied to license plate, which would also be
used to determine the fee in the case of a lost ticket.
- So how would it work ? Looks like you still need to take a ticket, but
wouldn't need to pay to exit, your license plate would be used.
- Alternate credentials would still be necessary in the case of snow.

## Remote rate push capability
- The push is away from cashiers towards automated lanes. But, no ability from 
command center to push a rate out to a lane. 
- You can have now a camera in the lane and..
- Ability to push a manual transaction to a POF or a credit card exit
- You can tie it to a license plate which will close out the ticket.

## iPad validator
- it's on a stand and has a barcode scanner underneath it. It's automatically
logged into flexport via local wifi.
- Whatever validations that department has.. instead of havig to issue chaser
tickets they can push the validation they want.
- The validator is configured to bill back the department or third party
responsible for payment of validations used. 
- Have a user interface for the departments available validations
a ticket is validated when scanned by the barcode scanner
allows the customer to exit without the need for a chaser ticket.
But we apply validations directly to the ticket already so it looks like this
may not be great.

## Third Party Integrations
- occupancy
  - wayfinding
  - improved analytics of facility usage
- reservation
  - ability to prepay for parking
    - event parking
    - short term parking
- valet
  better tracking of valey revenue and facility usage
I don't think we really need this. It's for if you rented out your garage for
events.

## Ground Loop Alternatives
- Infrared loops for magnetic microdrive Gates
It's a meshnet of infrared.
  - allows motorcycles to be detected.
  - prevent pedestrian injury
  - alternative to ground loops in post tension decks or where interference
  - reduces need for civil work.
Do plows damage the loops? You would have to clean them. Not sure we really need
this.. 
They're just testing things now but presumably in Florida. The pedestrian thing
is a big thing.. But people don't walk near ours.

## Remote V4 Firmware update
- Firmware updates will be able to be sent remotely to the v4 controller
- this will allow for improved troubleshooting and serviceability of the devices
