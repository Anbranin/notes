So you want to raise or lower the garage gates?
why would you want to do that?
Well, Jon might ask you to because Bill raises the gates when he leaves, and maybe you'll have to do it instead? Or something? Like if Bill's not there or doesn't come back on Monday? You're a backup person.
Here's what to do.
- Go to Flex
- Go to Task Scheduler
- Go to Enabled: No (this task is not enabled, meaning no auto-run?)
- The task is called Lane Lower/Lane Raise depending on what should be done with it. Metin renames it every time?
- What you want is "Lock Gate Raised - Set to Neutral" if raising the gates
- "Unlock - Lower Gate" is what you want if lowering the gates
