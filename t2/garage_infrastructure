Deck drilling
deck is post tension no real engineer drawings, pin to island
it'll hold fine. if car hits it whatever gonna have to replace the equipment.
May get minor shifting island over time but you and I will be long gone lol
Want to do it the right way gotta remove the entire island but gonna add
expense and timeline extend. So, let's go with pin to island (black top route)

Pre-fabbed loop in blacktop, saw cut the loops or ... entries ... exits are
being saw-cut because we have to.
