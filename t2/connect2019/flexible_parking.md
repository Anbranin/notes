Question is are we interested?

# Brief intro to University of Manitoba

Winnepeg, summertime. harsh climate. 29K student 8.5k staff, 30k visitors per day
T2 hosted - flex for permits and enfiorcement
we're virtual permits patrolled by ALPR

# What is flexible parking

What is flexible parking? It's a monthly permit that better fits the customer's schedule
whatever time a lot is being operated we rarely consider what the customer actually needs.
we're incenticising people to drive when they don't need to! If they only 
come to campus once a week for example but they pay the same as someone who comes 5 days a week
would it increase revenue? we're using more space for the same amount of revenue, it would 

# Is it right for my campus?
  if you don't have high parking demand, don't use thas
  if you have a risk of future loss of inventory, this will be good to implemenet. if they're building new buildings for example and stealing parking. AHEM
  Ask you customers - social media is OK but like... you may get told to go to hell
  Transportation survey - ask their customers like, how you get to campus? if we were to omplemet this how would you use it?

  Run a pilot program

# Philosophy

Equitable
Built on choice
hang tags nothing on line was the history
giving more chocie is good choose what works for them not what we determine what works for us
Integrated multi modal commute?
investment in transportation systems will clse gaps
Flexibility - that's what we talk about. capitalizing on opportunities to improve changing conditions
access information or what it is but students are getting more demanding, so gota offer them more flexibility

Responsibiity
investing in transportation systems that reduce ecologicl footprint
environmental impact of having people drive when they don't need to

Innovation
No one bikes to campus in the fucking winter
so trying to get people not to drive when they dn't need to is rough
parking management

Suport flexible, acessible, multi modal choices

# Strategy 1
- create finacnail incentives to shift some trips to carpooling, transit, walking, cycling
- reduce demand ofr drive alone spaces, ensure accessible spaces are maintained
- design with sustainability in mind

# Transportation Survey questions
- What do you want ffrom your campus commute - target audience, students staff, communicty memebers
- goal to learn how peple commute? HOw are you getting to campus now?
- what affects their choices? Like waht makes the bus good or not good
- what are their ideal situations?

Answers for UofM
low numbers bike and walk, especially in the winter
ideally a lot more people would bike or carpool to campus
increase the cycling = bike lockers are a waste of real estate so wouldn ot recomment
matching service for carpooling? 

What people want:
- Better infrastrucure
- More flexible parking

They can't get people on the bus. Everyone drivees. Their bus is terrible.

Planning for a flexible permit pilot program

identify key statekeholders
- student union
- office of sustainability
- parking advisory committee

Communication plan
- campus newsletter
- wocial media
- word fo mouth

Operational consideration
- policies - theft o fservice
- identify locations
- adjusting inventory and oversell

IT/Sale component
- software limitations - Flex isn't really good with time. ELABORATE ON THAT?
- online vs manual sales
- waiting list setup
- adjusting inventory on the fly

# Pilot project:
- 50 monthly permits
- Their thing was M/W/F and Tu/Th because of their class schedule. 5$ admin fee per permit, reduced oversell capabiloty
100 flexible permits sold out in 3 days. Slow soft launch we do ahve enough demand to 
full monthly was 75 bucks, they broke that out into 50 for 3 days and 35
6,000 increase in revenue  (over what period of time? I forgot.) One month?

Oversell factor - 

Revenue increases
3,075 increase monthly for 87 tuThu permits at 35$
grow the program: more lots, more flexibility
- add part day permits - flex can't handle that right now.
- a la carte parking? it'd be cool to have a dropdown to be like "what days you want to comein?" like that's how you maximize your lots.

Challenges:
- Understanding customer needs
- Enforcement (how do you do that?)

GeneTec we use for LPR how did you set that up? send them a custom file.
When an officer is going around, it's easy for them to see - right? 
But the LPR thing we'd need to talk to Genetec.


wins:
More parkers in less space
increase in monthly revenue
happier customers
systainabilit

customized flexible permits would be the best

Enforcement - how is that 
trouble? We have an evening permit time of day T2 doesn't sell a permit from this time to this time GeneTec side we can say in the rulles from 4-midnight this permit works here
that's what they're doing, because of LPR
The one thing they wanted is hosted T2 moved student permits to virtual do flexible yeah and had to cut it down
morning afternoons or MWF Th, cut in half just did days
we do use GeneTec
2 permit groups, MWF and TuTh, then export permit files to GeneTec and they do it that way to get 
Does GeneTec charge extra to get permit files 
So this works when you have LPR and.. other times may not. Enforcement
might be difficult. Because you'd need to do it with genetec to get teh things out
because Flex doesn't know times - it won't recognize Monday versus Tuesday for example, it just has start thru end.

So what could an enforcement option be?
