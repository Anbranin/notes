# Goals of Space Management
## immediate goals
- sell as many permits as possible
- do not overflow any lots

### Step 1: Monitoring Permit Sales by Area
#### Come up with permit targets for each lot
- Targets are based on data points and regularly adjust
  Q: _What are e-permits?_
  - pre e-permt targets
  things to look at, active permits & space occupancy data
- Uncertainties:
  - oversell ratio
  (number of permits active devided by number of spaces)
  - parking behavior/purchasing trends
#### Meeting the Targets
  To reach our target permit numbers we monitor:
  
##### the number of allotments
  Q. _What are allotments?_
  The way we use them is they're basically reserved permits given to each department in order to distribute to their employees at their disposa.
  Once we give them all these allotments they can give them to any of their staff/students and it takes work off us.
  
  This is for if departments purchased permits for their staff or whatever. specifically they're talking about e-permits.

  We control the number of allotments in the beginning but can request more. The depts can request more.
  It also puts the political decisionmaking on the deepartment. It just all goes through the department.
  That would not work for us.

##### Student application permits
- quarterly permits provided to non-professional school student commuters.
The number offered is based on remaining space, i.e. targets minus:
 - allotments
 - subclass controlled permits
   Include night, weekend, law, x, retiree, daily permits
   they work well when they don't want to or need to control the number of permits being sold (like we just sell the permits to students until they're gone, we don't restrict it. At least, usually.)
 - construction impact
 - daily permits

1 day and cross-parking permits
started with 30 available each day per structure, adjusted to meet demand
last line of immediate overflow defense - we can change number that gets sold just by chanign the capacity
we can lower the capacity from 30 down to 10... we'll gain 20 spaces.

reduce daily facility capacities for upcoming events ,can 0 it out jsut for that day

structure with tons of open space you can raise it

They set up separate facilities for these permits
cross-parking permits are like, for different structures

##### Putting it all together:
You take the facility
then find out the permit target for the given time period - number
then the peak construction impact (if applicable) - this is a number too
then number of allotments (purchased and non-purchased)
subclass controlled permits - there's no limit on how many of these are sold, right? Like lots get full--is that controlled by the facility capacity? probably.
student application permits - I don't tink we use this
and then after subtracting all these numbers is the daily facility capacity.? Looks liek that's not the case. I don't think this is useful. It's a table but
I don't know hwo they got the numbers.

Waiting lists
- that's how they sell the student application permits. They rank them in terms of priorities
they give all students a ranking based on,.. their class standing, if they have scholarships. WOW. Then award the right ot purchase based on that.

So for example
lot: Lot 11
permit target: 300
peak construction impact: 20

##### Tracking space occupancy
How many people can we fit?
Go out and count
LPR
potential: object detection cameras, smart-sensors, fixed LPR, stretegic parking based on work/class schedules?
like say there's 5-8 PM class and a 1-3 PM class, they don't overlap so they would fit in a structure well together. Just having the fixed LPR data we can determine that.


## in the future
- park customers in more strategic locations
