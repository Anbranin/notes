# Virtual Permits: A thing of the past?

In 1961 the faculty were complaining that 30 feet was too far to walk.
This is not a new thing.

We've had paid parking for forever. The parking rates have gone up, especially in the last 20 years.
OHSU is the university speaking

History of parking technology

Pay stations

Parkmobile did a better job at not overselling - Flexport couldn't handle 2 people trying to buy the last spot at the same time.

If lots are selling out every day and you don't have annual permits

## Why Daily Parking?
Daily Parking is what tehy're
Make parking a daily decision
Daylight user behavior - make it visible
reduce SOV to 30% by 2027
reduce congestion
reduce long-term parking costs
reduce non SOV user costs

TDM plan
strategies - high impact/high priority
help employees get to there without parking
so a permit is way less expensive 
daily parking, or pay-by-use - disincentivizes parking. think about it -- if you bought a permit for the semester, no reason not to use it.
guaranteed daily parking - annual permit holders show up and are allowed to park in certain places but get charged for actual use.
It's easier to do for gated facilities. Obviously.
12$ per day for the first 8 days per pay period. Parking on any additional day per pay period is at a higher rate.
Then it gets increased to 15$. So it incentivizes less driving.
I can't think of how this would be applicable for people that park in non-gated facilities.
We could add gates... but we could go gateless if we did the car.
whitelist your badge - scan in at gate - logs a parking event on commute calendar (they're using Luum). associated charge shows up. So you can track your parking each day.
The bike riding is incetivizing - you can add money for example for riding a bike. 
So what do they do without gates... The gated facilities have been moved to this model but they're actually trying to figure out what to do with non-gated facilities--they have
some surface lots and non-gated garages. Like they're using parkmobile. End-goal is to make this commute a daily decision een for surface lots.
How would we do that....
Commuter Choice framework
Walk, bike, rideshare is free
Look up: "Luum"
How do you confirm that the person is actually biking? Well, you can confirm that they're working by looking at their Kronos... And not on vacation. They don't REALLY know
Iff someone's biking. They build an in-house app to find out.
  they do self-police though, the bicyclings
Some people have a monetary incentive for any non-automobile trip, but this university has incentives just for biking and walking (not transit)
They use parking-revenues to pay for that incentive -- other parkers pay for the incentive program -- it's transparent.

## Parking Facility Constraints
batch scan - pretty reliable. Badge scan I mean. 
Without gates: parking facility constraints. 3 separate entries/exists, 9 levels, single lane multi-use, free patient parking (that means non-registered plates), pay stations throughought Daily parking zone,
possible solutions:
Gates
- really expensive up-front
- cheaper on daily operation
- staffing can be minimal
- uptime is great
- accuracy is 100%
- employees are generally OK with it because they're bringing their badge anyway
- % of revenue loss
LPR
- cost is a bit, the units themselves aren't too expensive (but we would need to buy a car)
- staffing is obviously.. you need people
- uptime is like 98%
- accuracy is limited! 65% - 93% - because of Vanity plates ETC. This University is in Oregon that has like 15% vanity plates. You'll lose 7-35% of daily revenue because of the non-accuracy.
- employees are generally OK with it but "I got a new car/plate!" happens.
RFID
- pole and a reader
- operations? you need to issue a hangtag. that's not virtual!
- staffing is minimal, you just need to like.. put the RFID hangtag in the right place for the customer.
- uptime is 99%
- 73% accuracy. A tiny bit higher than LPR.. but what causes this? Windshiedl, where it's placed.
- are you willing to accept like 20% revenue loss because of the accuracy
- employees are even less OK with it because it's annoying

## How do you define success?
% of revenue captured
SOV rate? WHAT IS SOV? Single Occupancy Vehicle, you want to reduce that obviously.
Customer satisfaction?
Operational efficiency?
There's no place for this Uni to put gates. There's no physical place. You cannot back a car up onto the road.
The daily model that has gates works really well. But how do you do daily model with gates
When a permit allows you the right to park, but you only pay for what you use?

HOW DO YOU ENFORCE THIS WITHOUT GATES SUCCESSFULLY?

## Pricing framework
campus wide pricing permit
it's cheaper to have an annual permit but that incentivizes parking
Daily parker they can buy one day that guarantees them parking
if capcity allows...
  what about mobility... mobility passengers that need to dirve get an annual pass and they get assigned a specific place.
What takes away 80% of people tehre's odd ones that we can't solve.. we don't build programes for that, just masses.
Accessibility is the weird one they can have annual permits.  We reserve them a stall 24/7. 
They have time-of-day based parking too, I assume they set that up with Flex like we did with the garage.
Luum can do all that pricing.
You can get nuanced with it. You can do it per facility too.
Customer experience? They had some outcry. The customers that biked all summer loved that model.
the system manages itself pretty well.
