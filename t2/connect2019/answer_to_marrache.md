Kevin:

This is a summary of the hx of neurology at Togus from 2014 until 2018

1)
After months of planning neurology was moved from the 4th floor into building 255 in 2014. Dr. Boccia was the Chief of Medicine for the planning stage of the practice. His and the administration’s concept was that the section chief would set up the practice including be part of deciding on type of personnel  and then be part of the hiring processes.

Neurology moved months before the hiring process began, meaning there were four providers, an EEG tech and no support staff other than two newly hired MSAs. One initially greeted the patients with “Hey Dude!”. Neither had ever worked in a medical practice.

It was ridiculously labor intensive and stressful for everybody to take care of patients in a budding infrastructure.
It was easy enough to make lists of tasks needed to run an office efficiently and take care of patients safely except that it was not until later in the year  that  we hired a RN and the following year the LPN. A MSA joined eventually who was experienced and came with a good fund of knowledge in neurology. 
Many meetings later we had a team, people had eased into their new roles.
 
Up to that time ACCESS was good in that all patients could be seen according to their needs.
Federal access numbers were not good  and further steps were needed to address that.

Numbers surrounding access  did not make much sense to neurology until Luis Segovia joined to do his green belt project. 
I cannot recall what the title of the project was, he looked at parameters that determine practice flow with the goal to improve access.  

Kate Nelson had the numbers.
Luis helped everybody and especially our MSA  understand what was being measured and we started handling patient appointments accordingly.

A next step was the section chief’s yellow belt project. The question was how triage by an experienced physician would improve numbers.
The outcome:
…” Access improved to acceptable numbers …”…
For two months!! then

2)
Dr. David Camenga who had handed in his resignation in 2015 after his clinic had been ridiculously overbooked and he suspected that this could only have happened with agreement or at the direction of the Medicine Department had come back to work fee for service part time. He was let go in June of 2016.  Federal access numbers were the least of neurology’s concerns at that time.
To take over an experienced provider’s established practice takes an additional provider. These patients do not vanish in thin air. We did not have that provider.

3)
The Medicine Department had hired a neurologist, Seshurao Kruthiventi, MD. 
The neurology section chief, hospitalists, emergency room providers, nurses,..  found Dr. Kruthiventi incompetent.  Dr. K was allowed to linger for 22 and ½ months. Both Dr. Marrache and Dr. Stapley plaid key roles in this process. I suspect that a bonus may have been the incentive. 
The time was increasingly atrocious for all who had to deal with him and clean up after him. The section chief just talked to a hospitalist who said that he still had worries that he did harm to patients because of advice he got from Dr. K. and the section chief still dreads seeing the patients (still going on in 11/2019).

4)
On the bright side:
In 2015 the section chief had been asked by the epileptologists in Boston if Togus neurology were interested in having Boston read our EEGs. In 2015 Neurology  started collaborating with Dr. David McCarthy and his group. The project was/is spearheaded by Carol Riley. The equipment came from Boston, a team effort including OIT, CE, CAC, telehealth, Diane Fuller and others brought it online. The outcome is EEG equipment that can be used to record outpatient EEGs, inpatient EEGs, ambulatory EEGs (24, 48, 72 hours), video EEGs at Togus and real time EEG monitoring in the ICU.
We went life in the Summer of 2016.
Then the EEG technologist retired, a replacement will be a pulmonology tech/EEG tech hybrid.
The position is not yet posted (11/2019).

The medicine department’ role in all of this:

The medicine department must have had meetings regarding neurology access excluding the neurology service.

Decisions were made without communication with neurology and handed down. The one that stands out was to make the EEG tech check in patients. The job is comparable to working at the post office and having customers stare at one all day long.

EEG techs understand and can troubleshoot their equipment, they read the EEG as they record it and may change how they record according to their findings. They are skilled at making patients comfortable and allowing them to fall asleep, to do what it takes to make a diagnosis.

This sounds simple, but was very challenging for the practice. To have one malcontent and later destructive person in a small place takes a lot out of everyone. 

The medicine department decided that we needed a MSA. Initially the LPN checked patients in. I did not disagree with this step at all except that I had one day notice and no space for one person.
We winged it,  asked the janitorial service where to get a cubical and received a cubical.

Making more work stations was again very time consuming. Dr. McKee’s idea was to do the EEGs again in Bldg. 200 and he had found space.  He and I looked at space and we ended up moving the EEG lab.

We did not see much of Dr. Marrache in bldg. 255. One of the few, if not the only occasion that year was a visit to ream the RN and section chief out for having stolen a cubicle that had been purchased for somewhere else.

A visit this last year started with reminding the nurses that a patient was waiting, the MSA had stepped out. Both nurses were on the phone and felt reprimanded for ??

Other ideas that came out of the medicine office still add to our daily work.” 
Patients that have been seen in a department within two years will be scheduled as follow up patients. They had been scheduled as follow up patients after triage except it was now up to the requesting provider to notify the ward clerk. Really? The providers are getting view alerted, since they are the only ones known to the providers. Even providers don’t know who their MSA will be the following day.

Et cetera et cetera
						-------

In 2017 the section chief was not able to keep up, taking care of Dr. K’s and patients in general took more time than was available, constant triage was necessary. By October she was entirely burned out and ready to leave.

Dr. Sears knew what was happening. He was part of most meetings. I don’t believe that as an ID specialist he had the medical experience to fully understand.

While she was on vacation Dr. Sears had asked Dr. Schimelman to take care of neurology

Brad knows how to run an office.
He made sure the section chief had not lost her mind completely, helped get organized again, added an educational aspect to the practice, monthly neuro journal club. He attended meetings whenever possible, stuck his nose into the office once in a while, was well liked by nurses and providers, things ran smoothly and were fun. Access was good.


11/2019

Dr. Marrache took over neurology again and backstabbing began once more.

The significant problems and the beginning of the end of the practice began when the section chief had planned to be away on a two week vacation and Dr. Mehta was going to be by himself. His schedule was fully booked. The schedule we had designed to allow an hour time for on call obligations had been changed by the medicine department (without our knowledge), I asked repeatedly that it be changed back using his on-call schedule for the two weeks. Stacey Morissette stalled. Mehta became desperate, Maureen Haley RN went upstairs to the medicine department and complaint…
I had protected my schedule by giving every patient a one hour f/u scheduling ahead and then had time to see patients when they needed to be seen. Access was good.

Except that Dr. Marrache was using SPARQ numbers without bothering to consult the instruction manual…..

Maureen’s performance got worse. She became emotionally labile, judgment became poor.
I wrote a note to Tara Chamberlin, the department RN supervisor. We talked. I did not receive follow up of any kind. I did receive Maureen back.
Maureen had weight loss surgery now three(?) years ago, my suspicion is that her problems may be related. 

The medicine department then decided that the clinic nurses would write the infusion orders. Maureen cannot safely write for Benadryl.
She failed the certification for MS nurse, easier than writing orders.

Dr. Mehta was on vacation for three weeks, I wrote the clinic infusion orders, did all pre-infusion visits, was on call, had a full schedule – could not have done it without Debie.

Now Dr. Marrache capitalizes on an IVIG order to harass the section chief, who did not document an order properly – I have not checked that actually.



The place is hell:
Nurse is failing, has poor judgment, is not good with numbers, and more.
Mehta and Nutakki work hard, look perfect on paper and have no intellectual interest in neurology whatsoever. 
We are on our 5th or more MSA, this one is slowly improving

When we last met you asked if I would stay. I said yes twice. 

Later walking across the lawn to my car the question popped back into my mind and this time I yelled: “Heck no”!!!

And then came the loveliest phone call I have ever received from one of my daughters…


I cannot do this any longer – sorry

Respectfully,

Jutta
