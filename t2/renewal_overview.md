Possible problems:
WEB_REQUIRES_RENEWAL
- must be checked. sometimes it isn't.
Employee Fee customisation
- custom field. It's something like 20P12 (year-type-lot) and can be wrong.
"is renewable" - feee schedule -> renewal schedule -> "replacement control group"
 - this is what determines what the old permit group can be renewed into. So
 for example 19P12's replacement control group is 20P12.
