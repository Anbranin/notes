intention:
Any time there's a businfo board you must relay that information in hearing


using the PVTA realtime feed - deployed at westfield / holyoke transportation center
whenever there's a bus arriving in 5 minutes it announces it
uses wav files coordinated with realtime feed
monitors the feed & monitors all departures for a stop/set of stops

uses Whenever
-----
Schedule.rb

Every minute after 5AM until 3am it looks at the feed
It remembers all the buses that previously were 6 or more minutes away
and announces when it's 5 or less away (so they only get announced once)

git pull at 4am & update crontab

Source code is in one file - we should arrange it in different classes

stops.txt contains stop_ids for the bays you want to monitor
maintain a cache of feed - json cached_departures

def run is where it's at

In the -voice- directory is contained the wav files that the individual
supervisors should be updating (kept on GH)
