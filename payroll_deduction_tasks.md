Payroll tasks:

Hub --> Admin --> Tasks

RUN ON PAYDAY (PAYROLL DEDUCTION IMPORT TASK)
  "Import task" (IMPORT INTO FLEX) (so it's an export for the hub)
  it's called "Payroll deduction import"

* If you forget in the morning but still remember on Friday, you can click 'run now'
  and it will still run and everything will be fine.

* If you miss friday, go in, "run now" then set the next run date in the _past_ (the last time it was supposed to have run)

Editing? Manually close the payroll deduction task drawer so you can select it in the dropdown.


RUN EVERY OTHER PAYDAY?
Payroll deduction export task in flex
payroll deduction check
payroll deduction export (export FROM flex)

If you miss Friday, the president's pffice will think we missed it -- email them -- Marcus and Nicole from the president's office
