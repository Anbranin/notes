- removing 2nd shift from student subclassification
( how many students will this affect? )

any problems from last-year's renewals?

- Why are returns / refunds higher than last year (are they? King thinks they are)
- People going abroad? Single semester permits
- Wording to make sure they know what they're purchasing
- 200 limit on semester-long permits
- if you're only here first semester, must purchase in-office? Jamie's idea.

How to make sure people really know they're buying single semester permits?
- confirmation box - confirm 1 semester only permit
- regular permits for all next year
Envelope may change this year
For the mt Ida - going to sell them online & shit we're just waiting on a dude
We need to make a thing fo rthis dude to log into Flex, give him PCO privileges (clone a PCO). He'll get the T2 app on the handheld
