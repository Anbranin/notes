We must use the CDN - content delivery network 
just use it from a server that's going to serve out the files

We can get the Javascript Library and the APi from a CDN

Small file will get downloaded with CDN and get the methods n shit that you need

those methods allow us to build our applications.

For the basic HTML Page, see index.html
