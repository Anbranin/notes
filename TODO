Only make API calls in the Flex directory:
  - Convert everything to spec/models/flex to type: :flex (metadata) - rails helper
  - Eventually, put this in the .rspec folder: 
    rspec ~tag type:flex which will not run the :flex type tests by default
  stub all the Flex calls in one file or method that you call in tests that
  might call Flex. but not in the :flex type tests.
  - rspec --tag type:flex to run the flex tests, put that as a comment
