General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- if you store information about a person that makes them identifiable, 
they have a right to be forgotten (purged from your system). It affects any EU citizens and US citizens living in the EU. So
it will affect international programs. It will also affect us since we track user information - on Flex, mostly.
We need to have a plan in place to purge user information in the case of a request.
Since we use an outside vendor we'd need to request it. This thing is new and evolving, so not much is known about how to be compliant
when using an outside vendor. THINK ABOUT: Round three and erasure. But we are already compliant because we can just go
remove the person from the db entirely if they request it.
