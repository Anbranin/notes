`dudes.sort_by(&:name)` == `dudes.sort_by{ |dude| dude.name }` == `dudes.sort{ |a, b| a.name <=> b.name }`

WOW.

fragment = case interval <=> 1
                when -1 then 'now'
                when  0 then 'in 1 minute'
                when  1 then "in #{interval} minutes"
                end

Anything less than 1 gives you -1, 1 gives you 0, anything greater than 1 gives
you 1
So it's "how" you sort things
In the land before `sort_by` (there was no such land)
Yep, you can pass sort any block which returns -1 / 0 / 1 and it'll use that to 
compare and sort pairs of objects in your collection
