## Problems:
1. Sensitive data over email (doctor's notes)
2. Cannot have a shared email account
3. Cannot use a google sheet - UMass does not have a business affiliation with Google

## Solutions:
1. New web form
  - passenger logs in - we get their information from shibboleth
  - check a box that says they're OK with us contacting their doctor - actually that could NOT happen.
  - should the passenger be able to go back in and check the status of anything or correct anything?
  - we don't want this info emailed
  - do we need a dashboard, basically.
  - re-submit / revise / check status?
2. Role subsidiary account with an email account that's shared
3. BOX or RESTORE ST-PAX


## Questions
1. Do we need a dashboard for the STSPV?
2. Do we need a dashboard for the passenger?
3. If the existing ST app - if we restore it do we want a public facing component?


Why did they stop using the previous application?

as they were working through the issues - they realized that passengers were disappearing. So they weren't there. 
all the beginning of december they'd beeen dual inputting 
they were relying too heavily on the phones

january 19th
the fix was deployed, diana did not know that


adam:
- what we should have done is have a standing weekly meeting to talk about the status. 

diana:
- we should have a standing meeting, there were months going back and forth
- there was no communication after Matt's email "here's the fix"
