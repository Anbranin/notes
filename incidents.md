Incidents is used by springfield & valley

The way it started - shared form that drivers were filling it out, paper
Dave Klingener and Jamin Carroll would type that paper form into a google spreadsheet / google form
Then they'd transcribe it into Hastus, then PVTA claims database

Enter the form online - faster than handwriting
Transmit as much of that data as possible to Hastus/PVTA claims

Devise for authentication

Division - from hastus
3 kinds of users
- staff: see & do everything
- supervisors: shift supervisor, see any incidents that pertain to you as well as unclaimed
- Drivers can only see uncompleted reports that pertain to them

Driver: Fills out incident report, submits, it goes to a PDF, they print & sign and hand to supervisor
Supervisor: Claims & fills out report, submits, then it goes to the Supervisor report
Staff fills out additional details

When incidents are marked as complete they have to pass a whole set of validations,
validations that aren't required for saving but are required for marking as complete

Then you can export (you can export incomplete but they wouldn't)
