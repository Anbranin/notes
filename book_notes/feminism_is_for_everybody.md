# Introduction
The public she talks to is like "cool, cultural criticism" but when she mentions feminism, it's all "they hate men and are angry!"
and it turns out the self-same public has never spoken to an actual feminism or studied it (third-hand knowledge) in those cases.
Feminism as defined as "lesbians who want to go against nature/be men/take all the jobs and just oppress white men" is a
misapprehension of what feminism actually is.
QUESTION: Does anyone still actually believe that? The misapprehension I hear most often is that "Feminists want women and men to be exactly the same and they're not".
They just think that oppression of women (at least in countries that are NOT the middle east) is fake news.
Her definition of what feminism really is is "equal rights". Which is what I grew up hearing.

Most men don't like being the dominators. They don't like the violence against women. It disturbs them.
But they don't know another way, so they support the patriarchy.

The strongest patriarchal voice in the author's head is her mother.

At the end of the introduction she urges us to "come closer" to hear how feminism can change our lives.
Like any good storyteller: "Come closer and you will see: feminism is for everybody"

# Feminist Politics
## Where We Stand
Feminism is simply a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.
This broad definition allows us to see that men are not the enemy--sexist thinking is.
People think (misconception) feminism is about only equality and anti-maleness.
That's the only thing we hear about.
Mass media says women's lib is:
- freedom to have abortions
- to be lesbians
- to challenge rape and domestic violence
People generally agree equal pay for equal work.
Our "Christian" society believes God says Women are subordinate to the dominant male.
The notion that feminism is anti male leads to the equally misguided notion that a male-free space would be one where the patriarchy is absent.
Indeed, among early feminists anti-male sentiment was more popular.
- early feminists were angry at male domination when they saw men fighting for freedom but wanting women to be subordinate
I think she's talking about the civil rights movement -- the people fighting for black liberation, the men, were super sexist. Which is ironic.
Those women had to participate in struggles for freedom while being told that they themselves weren't free because of their sex.
These movements, though, "awakened the spirit of rebellion" in those women.
It was a bit later that they realized that not only men were sexist, but everyone. So anti-male sentiment dissipated
in the face o fthe understanding that females could be sexist and that sexism must be rooted out from everyone.
"Sisterhood could not be powerful as long as women were competitively at war with one another"
You must also recognize classism and racism struggles between women and ways in which we dominate each other.
individual black women became at odds with women  who wanted feminism to be about equality with men under the existing power structure.
polarization
difference between reformist thinkers (just get gender equality within the existing structure)
and revolutionary thinkers (transform the system)
Revolutionary thinkers never recieved attention in the mainstream press or common thought. People don't know about it.
People generally accept the notion of "women wanting what men have" and this is what's in their minds as what feminism is.
Ooh, interesting take: White men were more willing to consider granting women's rights when it helped them maintain white supremacy.
Consider that white women asked for equality right after the civil rights movement - when black men "might have attained equality with white men in the workforce"
Reformist feminist thinking overshadowed the revolutionary as white women could help white men maintain white supremacy by gaining what they had and keeping the existing power structures in place.
Revolutionary feminist thinking was developed in academic circles.. but out of the realm of public discourse, so was only available to the privileged (it remains so)
The current system (patriarchal, capitalist, white supremacist) thrives on reformist thinking being the only known and accepted mode of feminism.
Think about it: reformist feminism is anti-male and focuses on getting women -- a select group of women -- the same privileges as men while being able to
step on those beneath. It leaves poor or women of color in the dust, doing the dirty jobs that white women no longer want to do.
That is, these women now get to use  "class power".
"Lifestyle feminism" removes the politics from feminism. "You can be a feminist without fundamentally changing anything about the way you live" is ists message.
But take the issue of abortion -- you cannot be anti-choice and be a feminist. So no, you can't keep your conservative politics and be a feminist.
At the end of the chapter is a call to arms: Let's get the definition of feminism out in the world. That is, revolutionary feminism, to upend the system.
We need T-shirts and bumper stickers to share the simple message: "Feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression"


# Personal notes on the patriarchy:
I have realized how deeply sexism is engrained within me in ways I haven't even ever thught of. Sure, there's hte obvious
ways like that I trust female leaders and professionals less by default, but that is more easily rooted out and faced. One insidious thing
is my thought that I "just don't get along as well with other women." While it's true that more men share my hobbies than females, it's also true that
I have this sense that the true relationship is between a man and a woman. Like true intimacy is between a man and a woman and there is nothing
really beween two women. Two men can be buddies, two women just fight.
WHy?
Because I never saw enough movies growing up that passed the bechdel test. I never saw women being friends in media. Anyways back to the notes.

## Consciousness-Raising
## A constant change of heart
All women aren't feminists (duh)
Males benefit more than females from the patriarchy--but females still take part in it and are inculcated in its ideals.
Therefore to be true feminists, women must raise hteir consciousness.
Learning about patriarchy as a system of domination/how it's perpetuated and maintained is important.
Early on the feminist movement was largely about women releasing pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized. This is therapeutic and served to bring important ideas to conscious thought.
