# Memory Improvement
- The key to learning is memory. If you can't memorize you're not learning
There are 4 keys to learning you can remember with the aronym FAST:
- FORGET
  - what you think you already know about a subject
  - situational things going on right now that you can currently do n othing about. be present.
  - your limiting beliefs. you _can_ do this.
- ACTIVE
  - learning. participate in the discussion.
  - ask questions
  - take notes
- STATE
  - all learning is state dependent. manage your state.
  - to manage your state do some full body exercises. think about things that make you curious.
- TEACH
  - if you know you're going to have to teach something, you learn it differently. that's why book clubs are great.
Whole brain note taking: divide notes in to Right and Left. Take down notes on left, make notes about the notes on the right.
Motive. Motion. You can't steer a parked car.
MOM - three traits memory experts share:
- Motivation
  Reasons reap results. Be powerfully present.
- Observation
  Most of the time when listening we have no idea what people just said because we're planning on what to say next. we're not silent in our minds.
  have you ever spoken to anyone that made you feel like you were the only one who existed? that's who you want to be.
- Mechanics
  how-to. how to give a speech without notes, how to remember, etc.
So for example how do we remember a name? First of all when meeting someone ask yourself why you want to remember their name. Because reasons reap results.
Energy and motion tied to a thought make it a long-term memory. Brain-heart-hands.
Ideas have impact. There is information everywhere. Can you absorb it? Can you remember it? Can you apply it?
To retain this info: use it, be active, put yourself in an optimal state, and teach it.
